## Calculator

It's a JavaScript calculator built with Create React App

### Project Information

This is one of the earlier projects I initially did to familiarize myself with React and JavaScript.

The idea and concept are not unique as this is a pretty common app in many a portfolio but I do feel like it's something worth showing. It's
a functional application that I built myself.

### Project Considerations
  - The basic idea was to make a calculator
  - I opted to make a simple calculator as I didn't want to overwhelm myself at the time
  - Keep things functional without breaking; ensuring users can not click on multiple division or decimals in a row.

### Lessons Learned

I decided to use CSS Grid this time as it made sense with how a calculator is presented. Usually I use Flexbox but will use Grid during the times
it makes more sense to have something with a 2d layout.

I learned it's better to break components into separate files instead of everything in one file.

It was a pretty good beginning project to get an idea of the (many) different ways an app can be broken and how to take them into consideration when coming 
up with a solution.
